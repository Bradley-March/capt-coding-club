# CAPT Coding Club (CCC) Repository
Welcome to the ***CAPT Coding Club (CCC)*** repository! This repo will serve as a central place for storing all the resources, files, and test code that we use throughout our coding club sessions.

## About the CCC
The CCC aims to help members improve their coding skills in a collaborative and informal environment. Each session lasts for 1 hour, where roughly 30 minutes are dedicated to covering a specific coding-related topic. The remaining time is used as an open forum for members to discuss and troubleshoot any bugs, errors, or issues theyâ€™re experiencing in their own coding projects.

## List of Planned Topics
A range of topics has been proposed by members, and we plan to cover these over the coming weeks. The topics include (but are not limited to):

- Linux
- GitHub
- VSCode
- SSH 
- Connecting and using captain
- Coding standards
- Making NumPy fast
- Making Matplotlib pretty
- Astropy (opening catalogues / .fits files)
- Pandas / Data science / Machine learning
- MCMC sampling / Bayesian inference
- Methods/resources to learn new languages (e.g. C++)
- Mathematica 
- How does code *actually* work
- Coding for industry

If you wish to suggest more topics please bring this up at the next CCC or email me below!
