# CAPT Coding Club (CCC) Repository

Welcome to the ***CAPT Coding Club (CCC)*** repository! This repo will serve as a central place for storing all the resources, files, and test code that we use throughout our coding club sessions.

## About the CCC
The CCC aims to help members improve their coding skills in a collaborative and informal environment. Each session lasts for 1 hour, where roughly 30 minutes are dedicated to covering a specific coding-related topic. The remaining time is used as an open forum for members to discuss and troubleshoot any bugs, errors, or issues theyâ€™re experiencing in their own coding projects.

## List of Planned Topics
A range of topics has been proposed by members, and we plan to cover these over the coming weeks. The topics include (but are not limited to):

- Linux
- GitHub
- VSCode
- SSH 
- Connecting and Using captain
- Coding Standards
- Making NumPy Fast
- Making Matplotlib Pretty
- Astropy (Opening Catalogues and .fits Files)
- Pandas / Data Science / Machine Learning
- MCMC Sampling / Bayesian Inference
- Methods/Resources to Learn New Languages (e.g. C++)
- Mathematica 
- How Does Code *Actually* Work 
- Coding for Industry
- Optimisation / Parallelisation

We will choose the topic for the following week at the end of each session.

*If you wish to suggest more topics, please bring this up at the next CCC or email me below!*
